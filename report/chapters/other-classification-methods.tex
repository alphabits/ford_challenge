\chapter{Neural Network}
Here I describe some alternatives to the logistic regression used by Inference. Hoping to get a result or two from SVM or Neural Network.

\section{The winning model features}
First a neural network with 3 hidden units with Sigmoid activation functions, was trained on the 3 features used by the winning method.
\begin{table}
    \centering
    {\sffamily\small
        \begin{tabularx}{30mm}{ l R }
            Run & AUC \\\hline
            1 & 0.8132 \\
            2 & 0.8074 \\
            3 & 0.8116 \\
            4 & 0.8040 \\
            5 & 0.7959 \\
            6 & 0.8070 \\
            7 & 0.7975 \\
            8 & 0.8046 \\
            9 & 0.8035 \\
            10 & 0.8006 \\\hline
        \end{tabularx}
    }
    \caption{Results from testing a neural network model on 10 separate parts of the testset. The neural network received the three features from the winning model as input.}
\end{table}


\section{The top 3 features of feature selection}
\begin{table}
    \centering
    {\sffamily\small
        \begin{tabularx}{30mm}{ l R }
            Run & AUC \\\hline
            1 & 0.8286 \\
            2 & 0.8336 \\
            3 & 0.8345 \\
            4 & 0.8354 \\
            5 & 0.8272 \\
            6 & 0.8344 \\
            7 & 0.8370 \\
            8 & 0.8339 \\
            9 & 0.8385 \\
            10 & 0.8320 \\\hline
        \end{tabularx}
    }
    \caption{Results from testing a neural network model on 10 separate parts of the testset. The neural network received the three features from the winning model as input.}

\subsection{Extending the network}
