\chapter*{Summary}

In this project, the logistic regression model used to win the online machine learning competition ``Stay Alert! The Ford Challenge'' is recreated, using the Python machine learning library scikits.learn. Performance similar to the performance of the winning model is achieved by the new model. \par
By doing a forward feature selection, a model is found that uses the same number of features but consistently performs better than the winning model. \par
Finally it is tried to further enhance the performance by training a neural network model in the Python library PyBrain. No significant improvements are achieved by the neural network, compared to the logistic regression, but this is in part attributed to lack of computational resources.
