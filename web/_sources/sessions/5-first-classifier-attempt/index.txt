I will try to create my first classifier. I am by no means ready, but I was a bit shocked, when I realised that the official competition is going to end in two days. I can't finish this project without a single contribution to the original competition. Before I can start making a classifier, I am going to find a couple of features that looks promising.

.. note::

    Apparently trials 469-479 (both inclusive) is missing...


Feature safari
==============

First I am trying to find some interesting features. P3 and P4 looks promising. But after i plotted a scatter plot of 80 random inputs, I realised that the product of P3 and P4 is a constant (approx. 60000). Further investigations shows that the data varies between the different trials. I think that some of the features is corrupted in some of the trials. To get a better view of the data I will plot some of the features for 10-15 random trials. Links to the results:
