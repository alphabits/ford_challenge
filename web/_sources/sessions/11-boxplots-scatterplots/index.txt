In this session I am going to create boxplots and scatterplots of some of the relevant features.


Boxplots
========

First boxplots. I have to make a couple of decisions.

    * How many trials in each boxplot?

    * How many features to create boxplots of?

    * Should it be the same trials in the different boxplots?

    * And which trials should i use?

And I think I have the answers

    * I think 50 trials strikes the right balance between having enough trials to make the plots interesting, and at the same time, being interpretable

    * I think I am going to create boxplots of all the features, except the ones I have found is zero throughout the whole dataset.

    * I am going to just use the first 50 trials. Maybe this is stupid but I am not sure I earn anything by selecting a random set of trials. Actually it might be more interesting to see the trend in the quartiles of a feature for 50 sequential trials.

The boxplots have been created. Had some troubles getting the xaxis look good. Ended up only labeling every 10'th trial. The code for plotting the boxplots is shown here. I have made it easy to plot a random trial interval, and have plotted the trials 1-50, 51-100, 100-150
