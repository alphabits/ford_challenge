This time I presented the results I've got from :doc:`../9-data-exploration/index` to Morten. I begin to get a pretty clear picture of the data. We decide that I should not normalize the data. Except if I am going to do a PCA of the data, which is probably a good idea. Morten gave me a rough outline of the general structure of my report. Basically I should focus on recreating the winning entry, and then (hopefully) improve on the winning entry. I think a rough outline of the report, is something like

    * Introduction

    * Data

    * Recreating the winning entry

    * Enhancing the winning entry
      
        - Forward feature selection

    * Neural network

    * Support Vector Machine

    * Sequential Models

    * About Python, Git, Open Source and project documentation

    * Conclusion

Which should be enough to keep me busy for a couple of hours.
