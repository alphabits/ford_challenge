In this session I am going to create transparent feature plots of all features. The idea is to plot the same feature 500 times in the same plot. One time for every trial. By giving the plot line a low transparency we can get a heatmap of which values the feature have the most. First we are going to create the naive version, that doesn't try to exclude the possible outlier trials.


Some feature safari
===================

I the process of plotting features, I got on a little feature safari. One interesting observation was done. Based on the transparent feature plots, it was easy to pinpoint outlier trials for some of the features. Feature P1 and V11 turned out to have two outlier trials in common: 92, 372. If we plot the two features in the same plot, it is seen that the structure is the same for the two features... hmm... P6 also has an outlier in 372. Maybe E4 got outliers at 92 and 372.

Also it is possible to make a few comments about the features:

    * V1 - Wellbehaved

    * V2 -
