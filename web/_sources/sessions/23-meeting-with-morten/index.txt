In this meeting I need to show Morten the first draft of my report. A couple of questions would be great to discuss:

    * Placement of theory section? Answer: Place after data exploration section and before recreating winning approach

    * His comments on my structure. Answer: Move the PCA theory from theory section to data exploration section

    * Not including every plot in the appendices, but refer to github account. Forgot to ask

    * Which plots to show in next section? Not relevant.
