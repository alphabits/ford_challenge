At this meeting we discussed how I should organize my work, for the rest of the semester. The fact is I have made almost no progress, and most of the semester has passed. Morten gave me some very specific tasks to complete before our next meeting at april 27th. Specifically I should have completed the following tasks

    * Create relevant plots of all raw data

    * Find candidates for good features to use in the classifier

    * Write the first draft of the data presentation chapter in the final report
